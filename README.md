## 💡 About Me

I'm a third-year Electronics and Telecommunications student passionate about computer networks, systems administration, and cybersecurity. My background in networking (Packet Tracer, GNS3, Wireshark) and Linux administration provides a strong foundation for building reliable systems.

This passion for systems and automation has led me to DevOps, where I focus on building, automating, and monitoring CI/CD pipelines.
