## 💡 About Me

I'm a third-year student passionate about **computer networks, systems administration, and cybersecurity**. I enjoy building and configuring networks in tools like Packet Tracer and GNS3, and analyzing packets with Wireshark. Currently preparing for the **CCNA certification**.

I love learning about how data flows through the internet, how routers make decisions, and how to troubleshoot and secure networks.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- 🛠️ **Cisco Packet Tracer** (for routing/switching labs)
- 🔌 **GNS3** (advanced network simulations)
- 📡 **Wireshark** (protocol analysis and packet capture)
- 🐧 **Linux CLI** (networking tools & scripting)
- 🧪 **Bash** (simple automation scripts)

## 📁 Highlighted Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔌 **VLAN & InterVLAN Routing** | Created and configured VLANs, trunk links, and Router-on-a-Stick in Packet Tracer |
| 🌐 **OSPF Lab in GNS3** | Configured OSPF routing with multiple Cisco routers |
| 🔍 **TCP Analysis with Wireshark** | Captured and analyzed the 3-way TCP handshake |
| 🔐 **Basic Firewall Lab (ACLs)** | Used access control lists to restrict traffic in simulated networks |
| 🖥️ **Linux Network Tools** | Used `ip`, `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `nmap` on Ubuntu server |
